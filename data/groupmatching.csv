4,5d8a2b0f887a21001543980f,1,I added a title to the recipe. Kind of an obvious thing I missed. Added more quantities to ingredients which makes sense when its for someone who hasnt made it before.,I didn&apos;t really make any changes on this one besides adding the title.,Including info on preheating the oven which I hadn&apos;t considered in the previous ones. This will help save time when cooking.,2
1,607ca741fd54ce0bd3846328,1,I edited grammar and portion sizes,Nothing,"Nothing but the instructions you have given during this task is extremely unlcear. I wrote 3 recipes using the software already before I came back to this point, and then it asked me for a fourth with no indication of whether the task was over. I close the window afterward and came back here so how would I have known that the last recipe needed to be completely different, because you didn&apos;t explain it.",1
2,592a232ed13ea60001553e51,2,The size of the pan. The tool was correct that I should have been more clear as the recipe would be very different if someone had started attempting to make it in a frying pan.,"I reconsidered whether I had adequately explained why the reader needed to check for excessive oil, so clarified what would happen if they did not.",I clarified how much salt needed to be in the ingredients but otherwise made no real changes.,3
5,62c43b4e60eba7f584e3f69a,2,I specified adding salt to the pasta water as I forgot to mention this and the prompts reminded me by mentioning using salt and pepper as a noun. Additionally I specified why I was adding red wine (for flavour) and the size of the pan you needed for cooking the pasta. I also added a seperate heading for the instructions.,I once again forgot to mention about adding the salt to the rice but and was prompted by the mention of salt/pepper as nouns. Otherwise I didn&apos;t really modify much as I remembered the tips from the previous time.,I didn&apos;t change anything this time as I remembered the tips from the previous two occasions.,5
5,62c7c1ce37eb8eeebddc0c77,2,I originally wrote place all the vegetables into the pan on the same step and realized it might be better to keep them separate so the order is clear.,I added the ingredients in the first step to separate them and list them out clearly so the reader knew what they needed for the recipe.,I added a description of why I did a step to make my reasoning more clear and so reader will be more likely to follow the direction.,3
3,5f1e33e58d05fc3a189c6ab4,1,"I didn&apos;t make any changes, but I would moving forward.","I didn&apos;t need to edit, I was satisfied with my recipe.","Nothing necessarily, I liked mine how it was.",5

4,5e68d82dd39ce517eaccd0c2,2,"I added most of the ingredient measurements to the start of the page, so that I could be less specific and verbose within the written instructions. For example, I wrote to put in one onion, however by including this in the ingredients list I could simply say to add the onion without specifying how much. I think this makes the recipe easier to follow. I also added step numbers, since I realise that can be helpful to include on top of written order like &apos;Firstly&apos;, &apos;Next&apos;, &apos;Finally&apos;. I feel this makes it easier to follow the steps.","I now specified not just how much of an ingredient to include in the recipe within the ingredents list (rather than in the instructions), but instead specified how I wanted it to be prepared. As an example, I mention the chicken should be diced. I think this can save the reader time as a step does not need to be included for such basic preparation, as even an ameteur cook should know to cube some chicken. This is therefore better included in the ingredients list, rather than as part of the instructions. I also decided to split the instructions up into more smaller steps, as this seems to read better.","I added brackets on a step to provide advice that may otherwise confuse the reader, as it looked to have good use from the example recipe. People often overcook carbonara because they only serve when the sauce is the thickness they desire while it is in the pan, not realising that it will continue to thicken a little more once served. I added brackets explaining this so that this common mistake is hopefully not repeated.",6
2,5e87376eb4921a37c33affb4,1,"I added more details into the recipe so how much of something. I removed instructions that were vague and replaced them with words that are more clear and understanding.

5,62ea9ad3007004e12c661a93,1,I added the type of cookware to the recipe because the writing tool suggested it. I also included the kind of heat to be used. The tool also suggested that I replace the verb Add with a more specific verb so I made the necessary replacements.,"As the recipe was for caramel coated brownies, I separated the ingredients and steps for the caramel and the brownies. I did this so that the recipe will be more clear.",Did not make any changes as I was now aware of the tips and followed them as I was writing the recipe,5

1,5d0245966e208b0017301561,1,I changed the structure so the recipe had a title and had ingredients listed first. This made the recipe clearer and easier to follow. I also used adjectives on HOW to add things rather than just stating to add them. This made it a nicer read and provided more information for the reader.,I added more specifics on the cookware - size of saucepan and that it&apos;s uncovered - and on the poultry (the cut of meat). I did this because it made things more obvious to the reader to ensure they follow the recipe correctly.,"I added in how long to cook things, as this provided more clarity to the recipe to ensure the reader follows the steps correctly.",5
2,60a746a3455cbbaefa083a14,3,"I specified the size of the saucepan, replaced the word &apos;add&apos; a few times with additional words such as &apos;stir&apos; and &apos;place&apos;, and specified whether certain saucepans needed to be covered or not. I made these edits because of the suggestions that were given to me because I felt like they would make the recipe easier to understand.","I indicated the different sizes of frying pans needed when it was prompted to as I thought this would make it easier for my friend to follow instead of struggling with pans that are too small. I also added whether or not the pan should be covered or uncovered to make sure things cooked well. This time, I indicated how the cauliflower should look once it is grated so that my friend would know that she is following the steps correctly and making accurate progress.","I didn&apos;t edit as much this time as I remembered to add them the first time round. I did, however, add in the colour of what it should look like. When reading the example recipe I saw them give indications of what consistency things should be, so I decided to add the colour the pancake should be in order to make the recipe easy to follow.",3

1,63127690860023ab6b50a0b2,2,I changed my original recipe by specifying the difference between the steps and ingredients. I also added more steps for the measurement of ingredients and added steps for making the baking tray/bowl non-stick so the prepared recipe doesn&apos;t become ruined at the end.,"On this one, I believe I took a lot of what I learned from the first step and most of my recipe looked pretty good. Some things I fixed while taking inspiration from the example recipe is firstly, I never added a title for the recipe. Secondly, I originally wrote a frying pan instead of specifying something like a large, non-stick frying pan. However, I believe the steps for my recipe were fairly easy to follow along.","In this recipe, I had to completely make up something from my imagination that I had never tried before and I believe it came out pretty well. The only change I made while observing the example recipe was add the softening of almond butter to the ingredients and not to the steps so the reader is fully aware what they will be doing to the ingredient before already getting halfway through the recipe.",7

I changed it to make the instructions easier to read and follow.","Didn&apos;t really make any edits since I followed the tips I took for the last recipe. Since the tips don&apos;t seem to change between inputs, it&apos;s kind of easy to use it as a checklist and make sure everything looks right.","Similarly to the last one, I didn&apos;t really make any changes and rather used the tips as a checklist.",5
1,62e97202c09c7186ec11f13d,2,"Had to write the ingredients in a list separately Had to define what type of meat and how it was (frozen, fresh, canned) The specificity of the steps needed defining. The time frame of the steps (when they ended or how long they lasted) needed to be clearly outlined.",Theres was lack of direction on the times for each step. There wasn&apos;t guidance on how to increase the portion of the meal. There wasn&apos;t a suggestion on how to ameliorate the recipe further if wanted.

Since my last recipe, I also added cooking times, to remove any need for intuition.","I removed from the ingredients list any additional unnecessary words.

4,62dc665a3bcd4f5ca37a9eb9,2,"After I made my original text and analyzed it, I added a title and ingredients section, and split up my procedures into discrete steps. I made these changes because it improved the clarity and organization of the recipe, and that readers would appreciate these changes. I think these changes also made the recipe seem much more professional rather than something casual, which also improves my credibility as the recipe&apos;s writer.","One change that I continued from my first recipe was that I separated the recipe into sections (title, ingredients, steps). One change I made to the original recipe was that I separated some of the larger steps into separate steps. This way, each step is about the same level of difficulty, and no one step is overwhelming to complete. I think this makes the recipe easier to follow by making each step simple and short.","I added periods to the end of each step as a formality, but I think it adds credibility to the recipe.

With the recipe being steak and one of the ingredients that was originally missing quantites was butter, that could cause disaster when the person reading the recipe is making it themselves.","I added some steps into the recipe for if the meal isn&apos;t ready in the time that is specified by the recipe so if the meal isn&apos;t turning out exactly how I stated in the recipe, they won&apos;t be too lost.

5,60f816ff1fa74fcfab532378,1,I wrote out the ingredients separately and numbered the steps. This made the layout clearer and was easier to follow. I didn&apos;t change up the verbs that much. As the dish was throwing loads of ingredients in to one pan I didn&apos;t see why &apos;add&apos; couldn&apos;t be used for everything because you were just adding everything to the pan.,I didn&apos;t edit anything after using the analysis. I did bear in mind some of the tips from the previous analysis though of stating the ingredients separately and numbering the steps. I also explained that the sugar was to balance out the tartness of the tomatoes and cool the spice slightly. I wouldn&apos;t have felt the need to explain that if I hadn&apos;t seen it in the previous analysis. Again I didn&apos;t change much of the verbs because it was one pot and everything gets added in one after another. In this one I mentioned how to serve it which I hadn&apos;t specified in the spaghetti bolognese. I think maybe because I think of spaghetti bolognese serving to be really straightforward where as shakshuka is a bit different and people may not know how best to serve it.,"This recipe was slightly different to the other two I wrote because it included a separate dish so I made sure that I detailed and differentiated between the cooking dish and the pie dish which required the oven. I also forgot to specify the temperature of the oven at the beginning for pre heat so made sure I added that after I saw note about heat. In this recipe I was able to change the verbs slightly so used mix, lay and dissolve rather than just add. This was fitting though as there were a few different processes happening simultaneously whereas the dishes before were mostly just in one pot and all the ingredients added together. I need to explain the mixture consistency and appearance a bit more in this dish and added some extra tips and info once I saw the analysis. Detailing when the mixture should be thick and glue like and then when it should be looser would help if someone who didn&apos;t know much about cooking was following the instruction. Giving tips on how to make it looser and runnier if it was too thick as well so the person cooking can use their own judgement.",6

I also changed the steps to be numbered as that may make it easier for my friend to follow the instructions without getting lost.
