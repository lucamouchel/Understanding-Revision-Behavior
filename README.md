# Semester Project

The pipeline follows a certain intuitive order in which it should be run locally.

First off, either run `DataFormatting.ipynb`, which processes the data and stores the first variables useful for all the other notebooks, or run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To install all the necessary libraries.

Then you can run `RevisionsStudy.ipynb` which is the heart of the project, or any other notebooks and observe results
